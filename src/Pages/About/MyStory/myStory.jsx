        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>
          From an early age, I was drawn to the world of technology.
          <br /> My passion for web development began during a university
          project in 2022, where I developed the backend of a web application
          for package transfers, even though it wasnâ€™t my original field of
          study. <br />
          That experience sparked my curiosity and led me on a self-learning
          journey, immersing myself in technologies like Node.js, MongoDB, and
          React.js, which now define my work. <br />I enjoy building scalable,
          robust applications, and the dynamic nature of web development
          constantly motivates me to keep learning. Currently, I am exploring
          Next.js, a rapidly evolving framework that excites me with its
          potential. <br /> I also have a strong desire to learn other languages
          and frameworks, such as Angular and PHP, to further broaden my skill
          set and stay ahead of web development innovations. <br />
          Strong time management, focus, and passion for my work enable me to
          consistently deliver high-quality solutions efficiently.
